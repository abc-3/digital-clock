# Clock in C++ using MVC architecture

The code is in C++ as `clock.cpp` 

* `main()` sets up the controller
* Controller instantiates a `Clock` object
* Clock updates a `Time` Model object
* Time is delivered to a `Display` View object


## Runing the code

```bash
g++ clock.cpp -o clock
./clock;
```
